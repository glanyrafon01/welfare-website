# Roadmap

This roadmap proposes a practical path from prototype to a maintainable, community-managed website.

## Near term (0-2 months)

- Keep content accurate and bilingual across English and Welsh pages.
- Add more photography and captions for facilities and heritage displays.
- Set up a simple content update workflow for news posts.
- Confirm contact details for tenants, groups, and clubs.
- Improve the homepage with dedicated sections for tenants and groups.

## Mid term (2-6 months)

- Deploy on a custom domain (e.g. `abercravewelfare.org`).
- Add DNS, HTTPS, and redirects for the custom domain.
- Add light CMS tooling for non-technical editors (e.g. Decap CMS).
- Expand the history and mining tradition pages with archival material.
- Add an events calendar or a simple list of upcoming dates.

## Long term (6-12 months)

- Review long-term hosting options:
  - Continue on GitHub Pages (free, static)
  - Move to Netlify or Cloudflare Pages for a more guided CMS experience
  - Consider a managed hosting provider if volunteer time is limited
- Add an online booking or enquiry form (external tool or embedded form).
- Add a donations link to support hall maintenance.
- Create a digital archive area for oral histories and photographs.
