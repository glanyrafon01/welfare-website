Over the decades it has hosted meetings, celebrations, and memorial events that reflect the resilience of the village.
The hall continues to evolve, balancing heritage with modern community needs. Displays, photographs, and oral histories help preserve the stories of those who built and sustained the space.
This hall stands as a reminder that community care is a legacy worth protecting.</description></item><item><title>Mining Tradition in Abercrave</title><link>https://glanyrafon01.github.io/welfare-website/en/mining-tradition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://glanyrafon01.github.io/welfare-website/en/mining-tradition/</guid><description>Coal mining shaped the landscape, economy, and identity of Abercrave. Generations worked in and around the mines, building strong networks of support that led directly to the creation of welfare halls.
This page will grow with new stories, photographs, and memories shared by local families.
